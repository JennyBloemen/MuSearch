## MuSearch

<h3>Description</h3>
MuSearch is a place where you can find any song you can think of. Sometimes we hear a little part of a song and we like it, but we donâ€™t know the name. In the moment we use Musearch, you type the part of the song you remember and then easily enjoy the lyrics and the song on your own or with your family and fiends.
